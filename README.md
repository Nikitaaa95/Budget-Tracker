# Budget Tracker 

## Description 

The motivation behind the project was to create a MERN stack budget tracking application so that after signing up and logging in, users can properly manage their expenses by having the option to add their income, expenses and have those expenses divided by specific categories. 
why? We created this application because it allows us to use both the front end (REACT) and backend (for the database) to work together to successfuly create an application that is easy to navigate and utilizes graphQL and well as MONGODB for the database. It solves the problem of being able to create an application that efficiently uses a database (from our models, typedefs and resolvers) that works in tangent with the front end web page so that users can view the data that they've input, as well as edit and delete that data. We learned a lot about creating models for our database, utilizing resolvers and typeDefs, mutations, as well as using REACT to build our pages. We learned how to incorporate our queries and mutations into our front end code.
